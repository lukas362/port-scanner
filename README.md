## Description
In October 2025, we decided to make one of the most advanced and secure portscanners in the whole class. We sat many hours programming under very dramatic circumstances, personal struggles and bad weather. Finally, when we thought we couldn’t be done before the first week, we managed to finish our task.

We can now proudly present to the world our port scanner.

## Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies (if needed)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```bash
# How to run your scanner
python multi_port_scanner.py
1. Run the script
2. Enter an IP-adress or URL
3. Enter the starting port in the range
4. Enter the last port in the range
5. Take a snack and a drink and enjoy the loading bar
```

## Features
- [x] Single port check
- [x] Multi-port scanning
- [x] Service identification

## Testing
Tested through scanme.nmap.org sites ports(1-100). Testing was succesful!

## Known Limitations
No threading function(yet)
Could have been faster.

## What We Learned
Basic port scanning abilities
To work in a team
Troubleshooting
Testing...and testing again
Better Python and Github abilities
